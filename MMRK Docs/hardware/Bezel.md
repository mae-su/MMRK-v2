The bezel is the front cover of the kiosk. It is fastened by four [M2.5 T8 screws](https://www.mcmaster.com/90236A115/), visible on the front corners of the display. There are four .125" spacers underneath it to make it flush with the display.

If you need to remove these screws to remove or replace the faceplate, slightly loosen the outer **rear** screws of the kiosk. Then, untighten the front screws holding the faceplate in place.

These four screws are also what four internal standoffs sit on to mount the display to the backplate. These standoffs are the kiosk's primary structural support, so removing these means the display is only secured by the standoffs used to mount the Raspberry Pi. *Use caution when removing these screws!*
