The bezel is the front cover of the kiosk.  



If you need to remove these screws to remove or replace the faceplate, slightly loosen the the outer rear screws of the kiosk. Then, untighten the front screws holding the faceplate in place. 

The bezel has a tight fit with the display. Be gentle when removing or replacing it, or you might damage the display.

These four screws are also what four internal standoffs sit on to mount the display to the backplate. These standoffs are the kiosk's primary structural support, so removing these means the display is only secured by the standoffs used to mount the Raspberry Pi. Use caution when removing these screws, as the standoffs are secured to them.
