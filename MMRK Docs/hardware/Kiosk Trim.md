The **trim** is the golden material that covers the left and top sides of the kiosk. In terms of both machining and aesthetics, the bend that wraps around the top left corner makes it my favorite part I've fabricated at the MILL. 

Both the kiosk and card swiper trim were made the same but, meh, I like the kiosk one more. 

## How it was made
The trim was made from a sheet of [**brushed, gold-anodized 5005 aluminum.**]() Let's break that down:
1. Brushed aluminum has a finish that looks like this:

2. This aluminum sheet is **anodized,** which is a process used to dye metals a certain color using dye and some electricity shenanigans.
3. 5005 represents the alloy of the aluminum. (each standard has its own number) I chose this type of aluminum because it's far more malleable and easier to bend than others. (although, it still does take some force even with how thin it is.)
