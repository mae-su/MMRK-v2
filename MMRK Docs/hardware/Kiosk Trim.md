The **trim** is the golden material that covers the left and top sides of the kiosk. In terms of both machining and aesthetics, the bend that wraps around the top left corner makes it my favorite part I've fabricated at the MILL. 

Both the kiosk and card swiper trim were made the same but, meh, I like the kiosk one more. 

## How it was made
The trim was made from a sheet of [**brushed, gold-anodized 5005 aluminum.**]() Let's break that down:
1. Brushed aluminum has a finish that looks like this:

2. This aluminum sheet is **anodized,** which is a process used to dye metals a certain color using dye and some electricity shenanigans.
3. 5005 represents the alloy of the aluminum. (each standard has its own number) I chose this type of aluminum because it's far more malleable and easier to bend than others. (although, it still does take some force even with how thin it is.)

# The problem with the old kiosk.
Here's an explanation simplified from [a Priceton article](https://www.princeton.edu/~maelabs/mae324/glos324/sheetmetalforming.htm).
> When you bend, stretch, or shape sheet metal, it changes its shape. This change can be divided into two types: **Elastic** deformation, where the metal can bounce back to its original shape (like a rubber band), and **Plastic** deformation, the other where it stays in the new shape even after the force is removed (like when you bend a paperclip).

> When we design things made from bent sheet metal, we have to remember that the metal might go back to its original shape a little bit after we stop bending it, and compensate by bending it slightly further.

With that in mind, the first version of the kiosk had sheet metal simply glued along its edge. As a result, the trim was constantly trying to pull away from the glue. It was hand bent, and not bent past a few degrees extra to take care of its elastic deformation.

### So what was done different?
Between this version card swiper and the kiosk, there's a secret third design that was involved to precisely create the bend:
