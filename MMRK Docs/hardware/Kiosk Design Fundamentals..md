### **The basic outline of the kiosk's design consists of:**

- Rounded upper left corner
- Rounded bottom right corner

On the kiosk, each edge of the bezel's edges lie 16mm away from the edge:

To stay flush behind the bezel, the gold aluminum trim is offset by its thickness to sit *behind* the bezel, instead of being on *top* of the bezel. Mounting things without screws isn't always pretty, (double sided tape all the way) so this approach hides that from the public eye.
